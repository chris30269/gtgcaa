        <p>We are so excited to announce the scholarship winners for the 2024-2025 school year, recognized at our annual reunion dinner during Georgia Tech Homecoming Weekend in the fall. Thanks to the generosity of our members and outside donors, we were able to award $1000 scholarships to four exceptional students in the Georgia Tech Glee Club. We couldn’t be prouder of these individuals as these students all embody the sound and spirit of the club in their own unique way.</p>

            <h5 class="is-size-5">GTGCAA Scholarship Recipient</h5>
            <p>Kaitlyn is a 4th year biomedical engineering major from Sandy Springs, Georgia. This year, it was the alumni association’s goal to support the growth of the Glee Club. In doing so, we dedicated one scholarship this year to a new member, emphasizing the importance of the next generation of Glubbers and the impact they can have on each other. Kaitlyn clearly emphasized her passion for her fellow members by supporting her section mates with difficult music and embracing the club’s spontaneous and outlandish antics. Thank you Kaitlyn for all you’ve done and we’re very proud to award you the inaugural GTGCAA New Member Scholarship!</p>

            <h5 class="is-size-5">Dr. Jerry Ulrich Scholarship Recipient</h5>
            <p>Robert is a 4th year physics and mathematics major from Smyrna, Tennessee. While Robert previously served as the Ombudsman in Spring 2024, organizing movie nights and social engagements for the club, he also demonstrates what it means to be a leader without a title. Previously a learn-by-listening piece, he helped re-transcribe Dr. Ulrich’s original work “Eagles Medley”, rewriting the music for easier instruction to future generations of Glubbers. We’re very impressed with Robert’s dedication to the club’s success “on and off the court”, making him this year’s recipient of the inaugural Dr. Jerry Ulrich Scholarship.</p>

            <h5 class="is-size-5">Crawford Family Scholarship Recipient</h5>
            <p>Jackson is a 2nd year computer engineering major from Lilburn, GA. Serving as the baritone section leader in his first year, Jackson is dedicated to upholding the vocal excellence of the club. He strives to consistently improve the technical performance of the group at rehearsal, upholding the club’s standard of excellence in vocal performance. After helping plan social events and end-of-year tours as Ombudsman, Jackson is committed to leading the club in more ways than one and plans to pursue even more responsibilities with the club in the future. We’re very proud to award Jackson with this year’s Crawford Family Scholarship!</p>

            <h5 class="is-size-5">Gen. Richard Browning Memorial Scholarship Recipient</h5>
            <p>Kai is a 4th year mechanical engineering major from Kennesaw, GA and for the last two years, he’s been not only the leader of the Glee Club and all its members but an instrumental influence of establishing the club’s culture after COVID-19. This includes leading his officer team, instructing at sectionals, and creating a brotherhood culture for all members to have a home away from home. We are very proud to have watched Kai grow from a freshman to soon-to-be Georgia Tech graduate. Thanks to the generosity of Col. Stephen C. Hall, it is our pleasure to name Kai the winner of this year’s General Richard Browning Memorial Scholarship!</p>
